            "Lesson #2",
            "Baptism",
            "Important Aspects of a Christ Follower",
            "<b>Ask about baptism:</b> What is your understanding of baptism?<br><br>" +
                    "<b>Define baptism:</b> Here is a general definition: “a rite of washing with water as a sign of religious purification and consecration (def. the solemn dedication to a special purpose or service, usually religious)”.<br><br>" +
                    "<b>Talk about the different types of baptisms:</b> Among all denominations of Christianity, several forms of baptism have been derived, including water baptism, baptism of the Holy Spirit, and baptism by fire. <br><br>" +
                    "<b>Define baptism with the Bible dictionary:</b> The Bible dictionary indicates that baptism, in general, symbolizes regeneration through union with Christ. A believer professes his death to sin and resurrection to spiritual life. As for most Christ followers, they come to a point in their faith in which they decide to publicly declare this belief and/or it could have been chosen for them at birth. As for a water baptism, it is typically performed in front of a church body and it is a public symbolic declaration of their faith and obedience to God. <br><br>" +
                    "<b>Read Romans 6:1-14...</b>Is this referring to a water baptism, a symbolic baptism, both or something else? The NIV Bible commentary indicates that immersion was the most common form of baptism at that time in which Christians were completely immersed in water to symbolize the death and burial of the old life and a resurrection to life in Christ as the individual is coming out of the water. Water itself is symbolic in baptism. It is a tool that we use to purify our bodies. We wash our skin with water in the shower to purify it from bacteria, dirt, sweat, etc. The act of dunking our head under water shows the congregation of the church that we understand the importance of what Jesus Christ did for us, accepting the Holy Spirit, and following the lifestyle that God calls us to live. We understand that before we had God, we were impure and after God, we have become pure with him.<br><br>" +
                    "<b>Differences among denominations:</b> Did you know that opinions on baptism differ among denominations of Christianity? In what ways do you know? In the Bible dictionary, it states that baptism is widely disputed among denominations. For example, Baptists believe that immersion in water is the only way to be baptized while Catholics believe that baptism could include the sprinkle of water on your head.<br><br>" +
                    "<b>Talk about another controversy:</b> Another controversy is whether a Christ follower needs to be baptized in order to be considered ‘saved’. For example, most Catholics typically believe that unbaptised individuals, including children and toddlers, will be excluded from the kingdom of heaven. <br><br>" +
                    "<b>Read Mark 16: 15-18...</b>Verse 16 indicates that whoever believes [that Jesus is the Son of God and puts their faith in him] AND is baptized will be saved. On the other hand it mentions that whoever does not believe [that Jesus is the son of God and does not put their faith in him] is condemned. <br><br>" +
                    "<b>Ask about Mark 16:16:</b> Is this verse addressing baptism by water, baptism by fire, or baptism as in allowing purification in our hearts as faith in God settles in? These concepts have divided church denominations for years. <br><br>" +
                    "<b>Read Luke 23:33-40...</b>There was no record that the man was baptized. There is a way to enter the kingdom of heaven without baptism<br><br>" +
                    "<b>Talk about the definition:</b> Basically, baptism is a proclamation of faith, expressing to others that someone is devoting their life to God and has received the Holy Spirit. <br><br>" +
                    "<b>Ask about the Pentecost:</b> Have you ever heard of the Pentecost?...This is the time in which there was the initial descent of the Holy Spirit among the Christ followers after Christ died on the cross. Christ promised that followers of Him will be filled with the Holy Spirit after Christ’s death. What occurred here was the Holy Spirit getting poured into the believers that Christ promised would receive the Holy Spirit immediately upon his death. According to Mark 15-18, many signs and wonders were performed at this time, including speaking in tongues and driving out demons. Some denominations, including the Assemblies of God Christians believe that one must ask to receive the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, in which speaking in tongues is the primary evidence that indicates that you have received the Holy Spirit, allowing Christians to receive the fullness of the Holy Spirit. According to the Bible dictionary, the baptism of the Spirit is widely confused with regeneration and with the indwelling, sealing and filling ministries of the Spirit, as well with water baptism and a so-called “second blessing”, which is believed by the Assemblies of God Christians.<br><br>" +
                    "<b>Ask about regeneration:</b> What is regeneration? Regeneration is also known as being born-again or the spiritual change brought upon someone by the Holy Spirit. In other words, an individual is converted into Christianity, repenting of their sins, and committing to a spiritual life. <br><br>" +
                    "<b>Matthew 3:1-12...</b><br><br>" +
                    "<b>Talk about baptism by fire:</b> According to the Bible dictionary, baptism by fire will occur during the Second Pentecost and is not anything that is relevant to us now.<br><br>" +
                    "<b>Conclusion:</b> As you can see, understandings of baptism differ. The similarities among denominations include putting faith in Christ and sharing this to both non-believers and believers. <br><br>" +
                    "<b>Talk about Repentance:</b> Baptism also shows God that we have repented of our sins to Him. What is repentance? What is the purpose? Do you repent often? Before being baptized or baptizing others, we must understand the importance of repentance.<br><br>" +
                    "<b>Read Acts 3:19</b><br><br>" +
                    "<b>Read Matthew 28:19</b><br><br>" +
                    "<b>Ask about baptism:</b> why should we baptize people in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit? Why not just God, why all 3?<br><br>" +
                    "<b>Read John 14:6-7…</b>Jesus is God in Flesh. He is a significant part of God. We must go through Jesus to get to God. Believe in what He did for us and we will be saved.<br><br>" +
                    "<b>Talk about the Trinity:</b> Remember this: The 3 forms of God are similar to the 3 forms of water. Water (H20) has 3 forms (Solid, Liquid and Gas). Even though H20 can take 3 different forms, they all consist of the same molecule. God also has 3 different forms. There is the God of the universe (who created us and everything that exists), Jesus (God in Flesh), and the Holy Spirit (God with us). Even though they differ from each other, these are all forms of God. See the relation?<br><br>" +

Look at Jesus for an instance. Jesus was extremely vulnerable because he was hungry, deprived and thirsty. Satan was speaking truth to Him: Angels could catch Him if He jumped off the cliff.

                    "<b>Ask about Jesus and sacrificing:</b> Why do Christians no longer need to sacrifice animals to atone for sin? God no longer requires an animal to be sacrificed because Jesus fulfilled a prophecy that cancels that debt that we owed. Jesus was the ultimate sacrifice, the perfect lamb. As verse 4 states, “It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins”. And as verse 10 states, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all. Being “made holy” also means “sanctify”.

                    "<b>Talk about fasting:</b> Fasting is also another form of sacrifice. Fasting is when you give up something and replace it with God.

At this time there also existed a tree as a choosing point. Moreover, Adam and Eve were given a choice to obey or disobey God’s rule. His rule was to not eat the fruit that the tree produced. The choosing point had the potential to completely separate humanity from the perfect relationship with God. Long-story-short, Adam and Eve ate the apple from the tree and then the perfect relationship between them and God had broken. Our (generalizing all humans) inherent rebellion from God separated us from God. We are aware of this distance from God. We may even try to reach God by doing things that He would consider “good”. Even though we had the potential to still please God, something was still missing. We need Grace. We deserve death because of our sin and rebellion. Moreover, we deserve both physical death and spiritual separation from God. In other words, we deserve Hell. Even though we deserve all of this, God has given us Grace. He wants us to live for eternity with Him. Because His love for us is so great, He has offered a way to come back to Him. He has offered a way to restore that perfect relationship with him. He sent Jesus, his only begotten son, aka God in Flesh, to take that punishment of death on Himself. He paid the penalty that we owed.<br><br>" +
                    "All of the sins and mistakes that we make in life can get quite overwhelming. You don’t need to hold on to these. There is no need to continue to remind yourself of them. God says that He will forget them if we put our faith in Him, through Jesus Christ. Your sins and mistakes will be forgiven and forgotten through what Jesus Christ did for us on the cross. If you want to be forgiven of the sins and mistakes that you have made in your life, put your faith in Christ. Let Him cleanse you and make you one of his newly adopted sons or daughters. If you choose to make this decision, contact a pastor of a local church or a trusted Christ-follower on what to do next. I promise you that this decision is the most important decision you will ever make in your life. God Bless.<br><br>"

The devil appeals to every group of individuals differently. As for Junior High and High School students, the world tends to show them and tell them things that may seem appealing at the moment. They are told that they can look better, they can do things to make themselves seem better, and they are told that it is alright to lust. As for college age individuals, they are typically told by the world that they are not good enough, even if they try their best. It might say that you must do this to cope with the stress of the world. Drugs, premarital sex and other unhealthy coping mechanisms are often directed towards that group. When you are older, distractions can come from every angle of anything. Even when you feel like you have accomplished something, the devil reminds you of something small that is wrong with your marriage, your kids, your job, your social life, your sanity, etc. Do not let these distractions take hold of you, though.

Worldliness is also internal because it begins in the heart and is characterized by three attitudes: (1) <i>the lust of the flesh</i>—preoccupation with gratifying physical desires; (2) <i>the lust of the eyes</i>—craving and accumulating things, bowing to the god of materialism; and (3) <i>the pride of life</i>—obsession with one’s status or importance.<br><br>" +

Typically we think of a giant pointy building with a cross on the roof and rows of wooden pews. We think of a pastor or priest with a distinct holy wardrobe that makes him stand out, indicating to the people within the church that he is the man that is teaching. We may imagine people singing hymns and a choir on stage during worship. Do these characteristics make up a Biblical church, though?<br><br>" +
                    "<b>Talk about “Biblical church”:</b> People tend to forget what a Biblical church is. According to scripture, a Biblical church is not a building or location, rather it is something else entirely. Let us refer to some scripture for examples of what a true church is. <br><br>" +

                    "&emsp;5. <b>Be together with glad and sincere hearts:</b> This is self explanatory. Be positive, loving and encouraging to one another. Read Proverbs 16:24 (maybe bold “Read…”). Our kind words and positivity are so incredibly uplifting and healing to others. <br><br>" +

                    "&emsp;7. <b>Enjoy the favors of all of the people:</b> Read Acts 20:32-35. If one of us has a particular need (ex. food, money, clothing, a place to sleep), do your best to fulfill that need. We should also be comfortable enough to ask for favors from others.

                    "<b>Talk about ‘spiritual hospital’:</b> One of the main functions of a church is as a ‘spiritual hospital’. As a part of God’s spiritual family, it is our responsibility to help one another in every way possible (and enjoy the favors of all of the people).<br><br>" +
                    "<b>Read Ecclesiastes 4:9-12…</b>The larger the group, the stronger it will be. “God’s family works best when its members work together”. <br><br>" +
                    "<b>More on the ‘spiritual hospital’:</b> A spiritual hospital is not a place where people are affirmed in their sin. Affirming someone’s sin is just agreeing with them that we are in lives of sin and not doing anything about it. Just being aware of sin, but stagnant - not doing anything about it. Additionally, a spiritual hospital is not a place where sick people brag about self-wellness. (Ex. <b>Bob:</b> Hey Bill, how have you been? <b>Bill:</b> Fantastic!

                    "<b>Talk about the verses:</b> These verses make it seem that judging is <b><i>not</i></b> in our hands. Uh…we may have forgotten some important scripture in Matthew 7.

Now we know that there is a correct way to judge and an incorrect way to judge one another. In the scripture, their problem was that they understood the scriptures only superficially (Ex. <b>Matt 23:23</b>). They were judging by “mere appearances”. Jesus called them to make the right judgment; ultimately this was a call to <b><i>repent</i></b>. Ultimately, <b><i>before</i></b> judging other believers, we must <b><i>repent</i></b> and <b><i>judge</i></b> our <b><i>own</i></b> actions <b><i>first.</i></b><br><br>" +

Let’s say we came up to a person who wasn’t a believer of Christ and you told them that what they were doing was something that was against your religion. In this case, it wouldn’t be your job to judge this individual who has different morals. Instead, go to one who is willing to take constructive criticism. This would most likely be an individual who has the same religion that you do. Since both of your goals are aligned, this individual should be very receptive if you try to help get the speck out of their eye. In other words, this is called spiritual accountability.<br><br>" +

The book of Philemon was a letter written to Philemon from Paul. In the letter, Paul references a man named Onesimus. Onesimus was a slave that had run away from Philemon and had made his way to Rome where he eventually met Paul. Paul then convinced Onesimus to return to his master. He told Onesimus that running away from his responsibilities and problems wouldn’t achieve what he had originally hoped it would achieve. The intent of Paul’s letter to Philemon was for Philemon to forgive his runaway slave and to accept him as a brother in faith.<br><br>" +

Many people (including many Christ followers) will use scripture like this out of context to justify their oppressive actions towards another group, especially individuals that identify themselves as homosexuals (even if they also identify as a Christ follower). Unfortunately, people take scripture out of context all of the time. When we take scripture without the full context, we might interpret it completely differently than what it was intended to be interpreted as.

                    "Dissect ‘fool’: It is time to break down what it means when you call someone a fool. To call a brother (or sister) a fool is to declare them (or her) to be worthless. If a man is but a fool, or worthless, it would be better for them to be dead, because there is no worth in their existence. When you are calling someone an inappropriate and/or rude name that is a synonym of the phrase “You fool”, you are basically, maybe unintentionally, saying “The world should get rid of you”.

Why do many Christ followers cuss, disobey the authority over them, are addicted to porn, drop out of school, do drugs, hurt others? Why are fellow Christ followers doing such things?

Read Proverbs 23:9…Why shouldn’t we associate with fools?…Their foolishness is like a virus or parasite. They feed on you and slowly become a part of you. I understand that it is difficult to let go of a friend, but if they are leading you down a path of negative choices, it may be a good idea (hint*hint* recommended by God) to not associate with them. In my opinion, we have to look at our level of spiritual maturity and our intentions when deciding whether to lose them or not. Moreover, if you feel that you are spiritually mature enough to associate with a non-believer with an intent to be a good influence and try to lead them to Christ, go ahead and keep that friend.

He understood that what has been given to him could be easily taken away from him. He viewed everything as a blessing to God, instead of possessions that he is entitled to have. He put God above all, even his family whom he loved dearly. He worshiped when God gave him things and he worshiped when God took them away.<br><br>" +

                    "Talk about working hard: According to the Bible, we are destined to work hard for our food. Obviously, many of our ancestors had to “make a living” by hunting, gathering berries and nuts, farming, fishing, and being a shepherd. All of this could be considered hard, exhausting work. Currently, we have many jobs and careers that help us to earn a living to provide food for ourselves and our families. Even though we may not have to do work that is considered toil, we still must work hard to earn the money to pay for the food.<br><br>" +

On one hand, you can stab your buddy in the arm, which is obviously bad. On the other hand, you can use it to cut a watermelon for your family, which obviously is good, because watermelon is delicious. Sleep also has the potential to be used for both good and evil.

                    "Talk again about spiritual unhealthiness: Another clue of an individual’s spiritual unhealthiness is if the individual is “doing for God instead of being with God”…Even though we are asked to do certain things for God, the main aspect of “being with God” is sometimes neglected. It is necessary to make time for God as often as you can. Additionally, we should read the Bible with intent to strengthen our faith rather than an action to make us feel that we are a good-enough Christian. Guess what? As a Christian, you are already good enough for God. God wants you to be with him. Build a relationship, rather than just actions to maintain the Christian-identity.

Jews, originally, had many religious traditions to help them connect with God. When Jesus came around, many of the traditions discontinued. As Christians, we have always been confused on how to “adequately connect” to God. Truth is that there are many ways to connect to Him. Humans tend to complicate things.

                    "Read James 4:1-12<br><br>" +
                    "Ask about the scripture: What does James tell us to do?... God is always there. The fire is always lit, and it is easily accessible. We have the map to get to it. We just need to remember that it is there. As verse 8 states in NIV, “Come near to God and he will come near to you”. It indicates that when we draw near to God, God will provide the necessary help to you, providing aid in fleeing from sin and lifting you up when you are down, if we submit to Him. <br><br>" +
                    "Read Romans 8:31-39…What do these verses say about God’s accessibility?... Nothing will separate us from God’s love. It states in verse 37 that we are more than conquerors through God who loves us. This is such a powerful message, stating that through God we will conquer evil. It is one thing to conquer sin and evil and it is another thing to conquer beyond that. According to verse 38 in NIV, “Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor the powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord”. Even though we may experience pain in hardships and struggle, God is always present and His love in Jesus will never leave us. <br><br>" +

                    "Ask about feeling God’s warmth: What must we do in order to continually feel God’s warmth and presence?...If we continually seek Him, we will regularly experience God’s warmth. We can seek God in a variety of ways laid out in the Bible. Some of these facets include prayer, worship, discipling others, being discipled by others, attending and participating in Bible study groups, and meditating in the Word. More specifically, in prayer you could tell God, “I want to be nearer to you”, you could praise God by worshipping with intent to connect, serve God in the church or community, and you could be more intentional in the Word with what you are studying.<br><br>" +
                    "Conclude: No matter how hard life is, God will always be there with open arms, visible from miles away, ready for you to receive His warmth and love. Once we understand Him and how He works, we can become stronger and can handle life better. Here are a few things that you may learn when reading the Bible: (1) We are not fully in control of our lives, (2) Life is unpredictable, (3) Bad things do happen to good people, and (4) Life is impartial, which appears unfair at times.

What are things that we often brag about?...We often brag when we are proud of something (e.g. a high score on a game, an achievement, when someone we love has achieved something great). Remember how much joy you experience when you experience something like that. Multiply that amount of joy by a million. If we allow God to, he will fill you up with so much joy in faith, you might even cry or fall to your knees. If that were the case, we could not help but boast.

As Christians, what are we hopeful about?...God fulfilling His promises (e.g. Christ’s return and salvation to believers in Christ). This is ‘the rejoicing of hope’.<br><br>" +

When we were younger, the world appeared 1000% cooler and more fun than it appears now. We would run around with our family and friends and scream because we were full of joy and excitement. When we saw a guy with a big mustache, we couldn’t help but giggle and point our finger at it. Even going to the beach or ocean was such a magnificent experience. As for me, there was nothing more fun and exciting than getting chased by the waves or throwing rocks into the ocean. I was in awe of everything.<br><br>" +

                    "Ask about discipline: How do we get to this level of discipline?...It is indeed hard to become a top-notch-Christ-follower. It isn’t easy being sinless. Actually, it seems basically impossible. Even if you struggle in achieving these, God still loves you. Don’t worry. There is always going to be something that we are not perfect at since we are not Christ.<br><br>" +

They felt comfortable and secure leaning on their neighbors for protection. They were too focused on money, power and alliances. At this time, Israel had an alliance with Egypt. Eventually Assyrians invaded and took the Israelites into captivity.

                    "Ask about Israel committing adultery: Why did God say that Israel committed adultery against Him?...God said that Israel committed adultery against God because Israel was unfaithful to Him by sinning and putting their faith in a country rather than putting their faith in God. At that time, if a man were to divorce his wife, remarry another woman, and then have sex with his ex-wife, this man would be committing adultery against his current wife.

Proverbs 5: 15-23. What does verse 15 mean? Be faithful to your wife. Seek your wife’s love over any woman. When married, you and your spouse are considered one flesh, one cistern, one well.

Although loyalty ultimately makes you a better spouse, a better friend, a more productive member of society, a better student, a better employee, and/ or a better friend. Loyalty helps to solidify a sense of belonging in this world, grounding you in the truth and your faith. Pursue loyalty. Do it. You won’t regret it.<br><br>"

                    "Talk about what the Bible dictionary says about forgiveness: According to the Bible dictionary, forgiveness is one of the most widely misunderstood doctrines of scripture. Forgiveness can be defined in several ways. There is human forgiveness, divine forgiveness, forgiveness in the Old Testament, forgiveness for the unsaved, forgiveness for the believer who sins, the unforgivable sin (which is controversial), forgiveness as an obligation among people, and self-forgiveness. Let’s see what the Bible has to say about these.<br><br>" +
                    "<br><br>" +
                    "Ask about divine forgiveness: What could divine forgiveness be referring to? According to the Bible dictionary, divine forgiveness is one of the most complicated and costly undertakings, demanding complete satisfaction to meet the demands of God’s holiness. <br><br>" +
                    "<br><br>" +
                    "Ask about forgiveness in the Old Testament: What could forgiveness in the Old Testament be referring to? Turn to Leviticus 4:1-21 for the answer. Old Testament forgiveness occurs when a sacrifice was made. In Leviticus, it was referring specifically to the Israelites being forgiven. Whether someone sins intentionally or unintentionally, a sacrifice had to be made (usually with help from the priest) to atone for the sin that was committed. This sacrifice would be adequate enough to cover the sins at the time until the appointed time when God should finally deal with sin through Christ’s death on the cross. Read Isaiah 53:1-12 for the answer. It was prophesied that Christ’s life would be an offering for sin. <br><br>" +
                    "<br><br>" +
                    "Ask about forgiveness for the unsaved: What could forgiveness for the unsaved be referring to? Turn to John 10:22-32 for the answer. Forgiveness for the unsaved is referring to the forgiveness of sin that is offered due to Christ’s sacrifice. Even though forgiveness of sin is ever present, the unsaved may never receive the gift of salvation if they don’t recognize it. Faith in God and belief that Christ lived, died, and was resurrected to forgive and cover our sins is needed for those to receive the gift of salvation.<br><br>" +
                    "<br><br>" +
                    "Ask about forgiveness for the believer who sins: Read Romans 8:1-17 for more on this. Salvation covers the sins from a believer’s past, present and future as condemnation is concerned. In other words, as long as our faith is in the Lord, our sins are forgiven and we will be saved. Is it easy to believe that our future sins are also forgiven? <br><br>" +

                    "Ask about punishment as a believer: As believers who sin, are we still subject to punishment from God on this earth? Yes. Read Hebrews 12:4-13 for the answer. The word “chastens'' refers to discipline or punishment from God. <br><br>" +
                    "<br><br>" +
                    "Ask about God’s discipline: What are some examples of God’s discipline for a believer? God will use testing, trials, and various predicaments to bring us back to Himself in repentance. The result of His discipline is a stronger faith and a renewed relationship with God (Read James 1:2-4), not to mention destroying the hold that the particular sin had over us. <br><br>" +

                    "Ask about repentance: What should we do when we realize that we have sinned? Turn to 1 John 1:9 for the answer. When we sin, he directs us to repent. If we confess our sins, he will forgive us and purify us from unrighteousness. <br><br>" +
                    "<br><br>" +
                    "Ask about the unforgivable sin: Have you heard of the unforgivable sin? What is it? According to some biblical scholars, the unforgivable sin was only possible to commit during Christ’s life when he was ministering in the power of the Holy Spirit. This unforgivable sin was called the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit. It appears that if you follow Satan and use his power to do what the Holy Spirit can do, it will not be forgivable. If I lived around the time that Jesus was alive and followed Baalzeboul, “the prince of demons,” and utilized Satan’s power to drive out demons, I would have committed the unforgivable sin. Jesus said that Satan can not drive himself out. We must overpower Satan rather than cooperating with him.  If this unforgivable sin existed today, churches would shut out those who have committed this sin. <br><br>" +
                    "<br><br>" +
                    "Ask about the obligation among people: Let’s see what the Bible says about forgiveness as an obligation among people. Read Ephesians 4:17-32 for the answer. What does this scripture say about how we should approach forgiveness? In general, believers should be kind to believers and non-believers. As a believer, we should be forgiving to all who have wronged us. Since Christ has forgiven us, we should do the same to all.<br><br>" +
                    "<br><br>" +
                    "Talk about forgiving yourself: We have discussed several types of forgiveness so far, including giving forgiveness to others and God forgiving us for our sins. It is so necessary to address self-forgiveness as well. <br><br>" +
                    "<br><br>" +
                    "Ask about difficulty with forgiving yourself: In what instances do we have difficulty forgiving ourselves? When we have hurt someone we love and when we feel guilty and there seems to be no way to make up for our mistakes. Read Hebrews 10:16-17. Why should you hold resentment towards yourself when God promises to forgive our sins if we confess them? When you choose not to forgive yourself, you live a life of pain. Our discipline often does not include grace and mercy. God has a design for discipline that is constructive and uplifting. We should let the Lord of our lives be in charge of disciplining us, not us. What are you holding onto that you should let go of?<br><br>" +
                    "<br><br>" +
                    "Conclusion: It is clear that forgiveness is complex and important to understand as a Christian. Please remember this: Since Christ forgave you for your sins and wrongdoings, we should forgive ourselves for our own wrongdoings and we should forgive others for the wrong that they have done to you. What resentment are you holding onto? Who do you need to give forgiveness to? Is there anyone that you want forgiveness from? Do you need to forgive yourself for something?

He developed the Mein Kampf, which argued that humans should be divided into categories based on physical appearance, establishing higher and lower orders, or types of humans. At the top is the Germanic man with his fair skin, blonde hair, and blue eyes. He referred to this race as the Aryan race. He asserts that the Aryan is the supreme form of human, or master.

Back in those days, certain people were assigned to interpret and teach the Bible to the people.

Similar to the Israelites turning to false gods for a false sense of comfort and satisfaction, we often turn to and idolize certain things in our life to help us feel better, providing a false and temporary feelings of comfort and satisfaction (e.g. premarital sex, drugs, alcohol, pornography, popularity, friends, and power). Rather than giving blindly into temptation, we must use our faith in God and scripture as our shield and weapon against sin. For example, Matthew 26:41 states that our awareness and alertness can protect us from falling into temptation. First, be alert, understanding that temptation may come at any time. Next, be well prepared, understanding how to use Scripture and faith to protect you from sin. Lastly, keep your fellowship close when faced with temptation, providing you with accountability and protection against sin.<br><br>" +

            "Share about the story about my blind and deaf dog: Who has dogs? Who has a blind and deaf dog? I do. You would probably expect that he would bump into things left and right as he navigates my house.. Well, you’d be correct, somewhat. Very regularly he steps on my foot. You also probably thought that it is nearly impossible to teach a blind and deaf dog tricks, like shake, sit, and come. Well, you’d be wrong. Even though he has his obstacles, he has been able to learn a few tricks along the way. With most tricks, there is a command that is paired with the action. With motivation from food, my boy Keller has learned how to “come” or move forward with a little brush under his chin, he has learned how to sit with a boop on the nose, and he has learned how to shake with a pat on the chest. Of course treats are what ultimately motivated him. Keller, even with his challenges, is still an intelligent creature that adapts to his environment and my wife and I love him equally to our other animals. Similarly, God loves you equally as much as the non-believer. In a similar way, non-believers are still intelligent, but do not see the truth of the gospel, and we should respect them as much as we would a believer, especially when sharing our faith. Similar to my boy Keller, non-believers seem to be on a complete opposite spectrum than believers. It is almost like they speak a completely different language than Christ-followers. Do you ever feel that sharing Jesus to others is like teaching a blind and deaf dog tricks? You’d be right. Both are not easy but both are possible. You just have to be patient and have a clear plan. <br><br>" +
