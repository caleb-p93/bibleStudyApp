            "Ask about baptism: What is your understanding of baptism?\n" +
                    "Define baptism: Here is a general definition: “a rite of washing with water as a sign of religious purification and consecration (def. the solemn dedication to a special purpose or service, usually religious)”.\n" +
                    "Talk about the different types of baptisms: Among all denominations of Christianity, several forms of baptism have been derived, including water baptism, baptism of the Holy Spirit, and baptism by fire. \n" +
                    "Define baptism with the Bible dictionary: The Bible dictionary indicates that baptism, in general, symbolizes regeneration through union with Christ. A believer professes his death to sin and resurrection to spiritual life. As for most Christ followers, they come to a point in their faith in which they decide to publicly declare this belief and/or it could have been chosen for them at birth. As for a water baptism, it is typically performed in front of a church body and it is a public symbolic declaration of their faith and obedience to God. \n" +
                    "Read Romans 6:1-14...Is this referring to a water baptism, a symbolic baptism, both or something else? The NIV Bible commentary indicates that immersion was the most common form of baptism at that time in which Christians were completely immersed in water to symbolize the death and burial of the old life and a resurrection to life in Christ as the individual is coming out of the water. Water itself is symbolic in baptism. It is a tool that we use to purify our bodies. We wash our skin with water in the shower to purify it from bacteria, dirt, sweat, etc. The act of dunking our head under water shows the congregation of the church that we understand the importance of what Jesus Christ did for us, accepting the Holy Spirit, and following the lifestyle that God calls us to live. We understand that before we had God, we were impure and after God, we have become pure with him.\n" +
                    "Differences among denominations: Did you know that opinions on baptism differ among denominations of Christianity? In what ways do you know? In the Bible dictionary, it states that baptism is widely disputed among denominations. For example, Baptists believe that immersion in water is the only way to be baptized while Catholics believe that baptism could include the sprinkle of water on your head.\n" +
                    "Talk about another controversy: Another controversy is whether a Christ follower needs to be baptized in order to be considered ‘saved’. For example, most Catholics typically believe that unbaptised individuals, including children and toddlers, will be excluded from the kingdom of heaven. \n" +
                    "Read Mark 16: 15-18...Verse 16 indicates that whoever believes [that Jesus is the Son of God and puts their faith in him] AND is baptized will be saved. On the other hand it mentions that whoever does not believe [that Jesus is the son of God and does not put their faith in him] is condemned. \n" +
                    "Ask about Mark 16:16: Is this verse addressing baptism by water, baptism by fire, or baptism as in allowing purification in our hearts as faith in God settles in? These concepts have divided church denominations for years. \n" +
                    "Read Luke 23:33-40...There was no record that the man was baptized. There is a way to enter the kingdom of heaven without baptism\n" +
                    "Talk about the definition: Basically, baptism is a proclamation of faith, expressing to others that someone is devoting their life to God and has received the Holy Spirit. \n" +
                    "Ask about the Pentecost: Have you ever heard of the Pentecost?...This is the time in which there was the initial descent of the Holy Spirit among the Christ followers after Christ died on the cross. Christ promised that followers of Him will be filled with the Holy Spirit after Christ’s death. What occurred here was the Holy Spirit getting poured into the believers that Christ promised would receive the Holy Spirit immediately upon his death. According to Mark 15-18, many signs and wonders were performed at this time, including speaking in tongues and driving out demons. Some denominations, including the Assemblies of God Christians believe that one must ask to receive the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, in which speaking in tongues is the primary evidence that indicates that you have received the Holy Spirit, allowing Christians to receive the fullness of the Holy Spirit. According to the Bible dictionary, the baptism of the Spirit is widely confused with regeneration and with the indwelling, sealing and filling ministries of the Spirit, as well with water baptism and a so-called “second blessing”, which is believed by the Assemblies of God Christians.\n" +
                    "Ask about regeneration: What is regeneration? Regeneration is also known as being born-again or the spiritual change brought upon someone by the Holy Spirit. In other words, an individual is converted into Christianity, repenting of their sins, and committing to a spiritual life. \n" +
                    "Matthew 3:1-12...\n" +
                    "Talk about baptism by fire: According to the Bible dictionary, baptism by fire will occur during the Second Pentecost and is not anything that is relevant to us now.\n" +
                    "Conclusion: As you can see, understandings of baptism differ. The similarities among denominations include putting faith in Christ and sharing this to both non-believers and believers. \n" +
                    "Talk about Repentance: Baptism also shows God that we have repented of our sins to Him. What is repentance? What is the purpose? Do you repent often? Before being baptized or baptizing others, we must understand the importance of repentance.\n" +
                    "Read Acts 3:19\n" +
                    "Read Matthew 28:19\n" +
                    "Ask about baptism: why should we baptize people in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit? Why not just God, why all 3?\n" +
                    "Read John 14:6-7…Jesus is God in Flesh. He is a significant part of God. We must go through Jesus to get to God. Believe in what He did for us and we will be saved.\n" +
                    "Talk about the Trinity: Remember this: The 3 forms of God are similar to the 3 forms of water. Water (H20) has 3 forms (Solid, Liquid and Gas). Even though H20 can take 3 different forms, they all consist of the same molecule. God also has 3 different forms. There is the God of the universe (who created us and everything that exists), Jesus (God in Flesh), and the Holy Spirit (God with us). Even though they differ from each other, these are all forms of God. See the relation?\n" +

            "Self-Control",
            "Important Aspects of a Christ Follower",
            "Ask about self-control: What are some examples of having self-control?…Being calm instead of getting angry about something, doing what is right even when you have a temptation to do something wrong, being sober instead of being drunk, etc.\n" +
                    "Read Proverbs 25:28…Without walls a city is vulnerable to enemy attacks.\n" +
                    "Ask about vulnerability: Regarding our self-control, when can we be vulnerable?…If we don’t set boundaries in relationships, don’t regard rules, laws, etc. One who lacks self-control is undisciplined.\n" +
                    "Ask about discipline: What does a disciplined Christ follower look like?…One who obeys the laws , obeys God, quick to respond, obeying those who are in charge to your full potential regardless of the difficulty.\n" +
                    "Restate the scripture: In other words, “The one who lacks self-control is vulnerable to trouble”.\n" +
                    "Ask about the statement: How is this statement true?…Drugs, Pre-marital sex, Violence, Abuse, other sin… The lack of self-control could lead you down a path of sin in a downward spiral.\n" +
                    "Read 1 Thess 5:1-11…vs 6 says “so then let us not sleep as others do, but be alert and sober”\n" +
                    "Ask about sleep: What could ‘sleep’ mean?…being spiritually lazy\n" +

                    "Re-read 1 Thess 5:7-11…Those who are unsaved are like those who are drunk, neither awake or alert, unable to respond as they should.\n" +
                    "Ask about being drunk: What happens to your senses when you are drunk? Your senses are inhibited and you seem to be controlled by forces outside of yourself. Symbolically, those who are unbelievers (drunk) are being controlled by the expectations of society (forces outside of yourself). These forces include peer pressure, Satan, addiction, sin.\n" +
                    "Read Gal 5:19-21\n" +
                    "Ask about society’s controlling ways: Are the ways of the world controlling you?\n" +
                    "Define Self-Control: “control of one’s feelings, desires or actions by one’s own will\". Synonyms: restraint, self-discipline, will-power.\n" +
                    "Ask about self-control: Do you have this?\n" +
                    "Talk about the society’s view of teens: This is our society’s view of young adults and teenagers: “Teens do not and cannot have mastery over their own desires. Basically, they cannot control themselves.\" Richard Keeling M.D. said, “Teenagers are going to drink no matter what the legal age is''.\n" +
                    "Read 1 Tim 4:12…Even though you may be young, it doesn’t mean that you won’t be able to have self control. In my opinion, young people have greater potential to positively influence others if they express their maturity and self-control to others. Individuals expect teens to be careless and they expect older individuals to be wise. If you do the unexpected, you can influence the lives of so many.\n" +
                    "Read Proverbs 23:31-35\n" +
                    "Ask about scripture: What does this mean to you? Why could this be a bad thing?\n" +
                    "Talk about the scriptural message: This verse is expressing how immature we get when it comes to sin. We try to push our limits and try to find loopholes to sin, which still winds us up in trouble.\n" +
                    "Ask about laws: If we are under the legal age of drinking, why shouldn’t we drink?\n" +
                    "Read Romans 13:1-5…We must obey the laws of the land. When we obey the laws of the land, we are obeying God.\n" +
                    "Talk about an example of self-control: The greatest example of self-control is Jesus when he fasted for 40 days and 40 nights.\n" +
                    "Read Matthew 4:1-17…All around us, we are tempted here and there. We have an easy access to porn, T.V. shows based off of dating (and the contestants have perfect figures), lies that are told from peers, media, and politics, etc.\n" +
                    "Talk about other temptations: What other temptations do we come across?\n" +
                    "Talk about excuses to sin: Whenever we lie, cheat, steal, commit adultery, idolatry, etc, our excuse tends to be the same: “I was vulnerable”. “I was bound to give in”. “Everyone does it nowadays”. “It’s normal”.\n" +
                    "Talk about an excuse to sin: Let’s analyze the first excuse: “I was vulnerable”. Honestly, there is always a way to reach God instead of giving into sin. Look at Jesus for an instance. Jesus was extremely vulnerable because he was hungry, deprived and thirsty. Satan was speaking truth to Him: Angels could catch Him if He jumped off the cliff. He could create bread from rocks. Instead of giving into the temptations that Satan was spewing at Him, He resisted.\n" +
                    " Ask about self-control: How do we demonstrate self-control all the time? When will self-control become a skill?\n" +
                    "4 Steps to achieve self-control:\n" +
                    "1st Step: Be aware…“Watch (be aware) and pray so that you will not fall into temptation” (Matthew 26:41). Be aware of what you should and shouldn’t do, know God’s principles, know Satan’s schemes. Read the stories in the Bible about people resisting temptation and read the stories about people giving into Satan’s schemes.\n" +
                    "2nd Step: Seek and know God…“Watch and pray (seek God) so that you will not fall into temptation” (Matthew 26:41). If you put effort into reaching out to Him, He will help you learn and maintain self-control.\n" +
                    "3rd Step: Get out of your comfort zone…Don’t try to blend in with your culture. You need to stick out like a sore thumb. We are called to serve God and live like Christ.\n" +
                    "Read Hebrews 5:11-14, 6:1-3\n" +
                    "Back Story to scripture: These Jewish-Christ followers were being immature. They were unwilling to go beyond the basic teachings and understandings of Christ. They were uneasy because the commitment to Christ would require them to go out of their comfort zone.\n" +
                    "Say: We need to grow from being infant Christians (feeding on milk) to mature Christians (feeding on whole food). This first requires us to train our senses, our mind, and our bodies to distinguish good and evil. As a result of training, we will have the ability to recognize a temptation before it traps you. Also, we will be able to distinguish an incorrect use of scripture and a correct one. All of these aspects of recognition and drawing closer God are the results of properly practicing self-control.\n" +
                    "Self-Analysis of Faith: In your relationship with God, where do you feel like you are at?\n" +
                    "Infant: “feeding on breast-milk”…You know and understand the basics of Christianity and you aren’t ready to fully commit your life to God.\n" +
                    "Child: “feeding on some solid foods”…You have made the decision to fully commit your life to God but you don’t know what that beholds entirely. You have the desire to learn more about Christianity but you don’t necessarily understand how to apply all of it to your life.\n" +
                    "Young Adult: “mainly feeding on solid foods”…Knows and understands most of God’s principles, you try everything to maintain a close relationship with God.\n" +
                    "Adult: “always feeding on solid food”…Fully-devoted Christ follower\n" +
                    "Conclusion of Analysis: Which category best represents your relationship with God?\n" +
                    "Ask: Instead of being controlled by society and sin, what should we be controlled by?…Everything that is considered good to God: The fruits of the spirit is a great example.\n" +
                    "Read Galatians 5:22-23\n" +
                    "Conclusion: All of these are considered ‘good’ to God. These are what He wants you to do every day, every minute, and every second. He doesn’t even want us to have an ounce of hatred toward others, lust, lies, covetous thoughts, etc. He wants love. Doing what is good will help you overcome and turn away from those sins that seem to harm you. As a result, we will develop good self-control.\n"
